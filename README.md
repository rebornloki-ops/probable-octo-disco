### My Path to Assembly and Low-Level Mastery

Welcome to my main code repository! I am currently 12 years old and practicing for 1 hour every day. My goal is to master Python and C so that by age 15, I can write in **Assembly**.

## 📂 Project Structure
* [cite_start]**dictionaries.py**: Mastering key-value pairs, `.update()`, and `.pop()`. 
* [cite_start]**intro.py**: The foundations—lists, slicing, and early logic. 
* **learning_sets.py**: Exploring unique data collections.
* **finalfinal.py**: Project milestones and "finished" logic.
* **haha.py**: The "Sandbox" where I test things to see if they break.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.11.2 
* [cite_start]**Editor**: VS Code (with VS Code Pets for moral support) [cite: 1, 2]
* [cite_start]**OS**: Linux (ChromeOS/Penguin) [cite: 1, 2]

## 📈 Progress Notes
I am keeping my original code exactly as I wrote it (including the "cringe" moments) so I can track my growth over the next 3 years.
